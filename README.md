# Auto Workshop — نظام إدارة هندسة السيارات

An Arabic-first (RTL) management system for a vehicle service workshop: vehicle
reception and inspection, live work-order tracking, inventory and parts, payroll,
accounting, customer records, warranty, and automated WhatsApp customer
notifications — plus strictly-formatted A4 inspection reports for printing.

> **Note for contributors / AI agents:** This project targets **Next.js 16**, which
> renamed several conventions (e.g. `middleware` → `proxy`). Read
> [`AGENTS.md`](./AGENTS.md) and the bundled guides in
> `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` before changing framework-level code.

## Getting started

### 1. Prerequisites
- Node.js 20+
- A Supabase project (PostgreSQL database + Auth enabled)

### 2. Environment variables
Create a `.env` file in the project root. The required keys are listed in
[`env-setup.txt`](./env-setup.txt):

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://<your-project>.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=<your anon key>
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=<your service role key>
```

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` keys are exposed to the browser (safe — anon key is protected by
  Row-Level Security).
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` is **server-only**. It bypasses RLS and must never be
  sent to the client. It is used solely by the admin server actions in
  [`src/app/actions/admin.ts`](./src/app/actions/admin.ts), which are guarded by
  `requireAdmin()`.

### 3. Run

```bash
npm install
npm run dev      # start the dev server at http://localhost:3000
npm run build    # production build
npm run start    # serve the production build
npm run lint     # ESLint
```

## Authentication & authorization

The app uses Supabase Auth with a **username-based** login. Usernames are mapped to
synthetic emails of the form `username@workshop.local`, so staff log in with a
username + password rather than a real email address.

Authorization has three layers:

1. **`proxy.ts`** ([`src/proxy.ts`](./src/proxy.ts)) — coarse, edge-level gate that
   redirects requests without a Supabase session cookie to `/login`. The public
   customer booklet route (`/b/...`) and `/login` are excluded.
2. **`requireAdmin()`** ([`src/lib/supabase-server.ts`](./src/lib/supabase-server.ts))
   — every privileged server action validates the caller's JWT with
   `supabase.auth.getUser()` and confirms their role is `Owner`/`Admin` **before**
   touching the service-role client. Server Actions are public POST endpoints, so
   this in-action check — not the proxy — is the real security boundary.
3. **Supabase Row-Level Security** — the ultimate boundary for all client-side data
   access via the anon key.

Roles: `Owner`, `Admin`, `Supervisor`, `Receptionist`. Per-page access is further
controlled by boolean permission flags on the `employees` row
(`permission_dashboard`, `permission_reception`, `permission_work_orders`,
`permission_customers`, `permission_reports`, `permission_employees`). These are
surfaced through [`AuthProvider`](./src/lib/AuthProvider.tsx).

## Routing notes

- **Public route:** `/b/[serial]` is intentionally accessible without login — it is
  the customer-facing vehicle service booklet opened via QR code.
- **Print routes:** `/print/[id]` render on a clean white shell without the sidebar
  or providers, for accurate A4 output.

## Known tech debt

Tracked here so it isn't rediscovered each time:

- **`any` types (~213 occurrences).** Several Supabase query results and JSON
  columns (e.g. `selected_services`) are typed `any`, which weakens `strict` mode.
- **Large client components.** `reception/components/StandardReception.tsx` and
  `SectorReception.tsx` (~2,000 lines each) mix data fetching, business logic and
  JSX; candidates for extraction.
- **Client-heavy data fetching.** Most pages are `"use client"` and read directly
  from Supabase; the security model therefore leans on RLS. Moving read paths to
  Server Components would add defense-in-depth.
- **A few `react-hooks/set-state-in-effect` warnings** in providers that initialise
  from `localStorage` (theme/language/currency). Behaviour-sensitive — change with
  care to avoid hydration regressions.
- **Root-level utility scripts** (`migrate*.js`, `copy_parts.mjs`, `check-orders.mjs`)
  are one-off maintenance scripts; consider moving them into a `scripts/` folder and
  excluding them from the app's lint/typecheck scope.
